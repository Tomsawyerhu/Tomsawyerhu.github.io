## Introduction

![](../public/pic/logo.png)

***

Jacoconut —— gets its name from one of the most famous java coverage toolkit, Jacoco. In fact, Intellij IDEA editor has jacoco integrated into its coverage plugin support for a long time.

Jacoco, as one of the only two default coverage plugins, not only draws its reputation from all kinds of features, like supporting both fly off & on the fly. Also, its art of design will provide much help for program analysis.

In memory of this great work, I do as much as I can to fulfill this project, hoping to make something of value.
